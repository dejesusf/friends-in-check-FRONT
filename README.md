# Friends in Check

## Desription

Friends in Check is not another chess game. Users are able to play games with a friend with a single sign up. Host a room and have a friend join in. Friends are able to talk and chat, all while playing a good ol' game of chess.

At this point in development, multiplayer and text chat works while in a room. Further, these capabilities would expand to a friend's list page for accessbility and a separate messages space when you're not hosting a match.
